##Simulating a Tic-Tac-Toe Game

#### Introduction

In this project, I tested the probability of winning a tic-tac-toe game by simulating 1000 tic-tac-toe games with the following configurations :

- Both players do not know how to play (Random Moves)
- The player who moves first, knows how to win
- The player who moves second, knows how to win
- Both players know how to win

#### Results of the simulation

If both players do not know how to play,
The win probability of the player who moves first :
The win probability of the player who moves second :
Probability of tie :

If the player who moves first, knows how to win,
The win probability of the player who moves first :
The win probability of the player who moves second :
Probability of tie :

If the player who moves second, knows how to win,
The win probability of the player who moves first :
The win probability of the player who moves second :
Probability of tie :

If both players know how to win :
The win probability of the player who moves first :
The win probability of the player who moves second :
Probability of tie :
